Project Title: Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM 
Description:
This project aims to predict future stock prices using a machine learning approach, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting. Stock prices are highly volatile and influenced by multiple factors, making them difficult to predict. This project leverages historical stock data and uses LSTM's ability to learn temporal dependencies to forecast future stock prices.
The project involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. By fetching historical stock data from a financial API such as yfinance, the model will learn from past stock prices and predict future prices based on the identified patterns

Aim:
To develop an LSTM-based deep learning model that predicts future stock prices of a given company based on its historical stock price data.

Objectives:
1.Data Collection:
*Collect historical stock price data using an API (e.g., yfinance).
*Focus on key features like "Close" price for analysis and prediction.

2.Data Preprocessing:
*Clean and preprocess the stock data for model input.
*Normalize data using feature scaling to optimize model performance.
*Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model accuracy.

3.Model Development:
*Build a Sequential LSTM neural network model using Keras.
*Use the model to capture temporal dependencies in stock prices.

4.Model Training:
*Train the model on historical data to learn the patterns in stock price movements.
*Fine-tune model hyperparameters such as epochs, batch size, and LSTM units.

5.Prediction and Evaluation:
*Use the trained model to predict future stock prices.
*Evaluate the model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or other metrics.
*Visualize the results by plotting actual vs predicted stock prices.

Scope:
1.Technology Stack:
*Python for scripting and model implementation.
*Libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, yfinance for data manipulation, and tensorflow/keras for building the LSTM model.

2.Target Users:
*Data scientists, financial analysts, and developers interested in applying machine learning to time-series data for financial forecasting.
*This project can be extended for personal or academic research on time-series prediction models.

3.Project Limitations:
*External Factors: Stock prices are influenced by external factors (e.g., market sentiment, news, economic events) that are not considered in this model, which focuses purely on historical price data.
*Short-Term Predictions: LSTM models are typically better suited for short-term predictions. Long-term forecasting may require more complex models or additional data (e.g., technical indicators, news sentiment).

4.Potential Extensions:
*Incorporating other financial indicators (e.g., moving averages, volume) to enhance prediction accuracy.
*Adding sentiment analysis from news articles or social media to account for external factors influencing stock prices.
*Building a real-time stock price prediction dashboard with live data streaming.

This project is a Stock Price Prediction Web Model built using Streamlit that predicts future stock prices based on historical data. The model uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to analyze stock prices over time and forecast future trends.

The web app allows users to input a stock ticker symbol, fetch the historical stock data, and predict future prices using machine learning
